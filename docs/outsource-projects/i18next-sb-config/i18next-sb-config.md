# Help add and configure i18next plugin to Storybook

Have a NextJS/React project that use Storybook (v7)
and use i18next for translation

Need help and install plugin and sort broken dependencies

https://storybook.js.org/recipes/react-i18next#react-i18next

See 
https://github.com/stevensacks/storybook-react-i18next/pull/17

It is possible that other dependencies need to be sorted

## Scope

- Sort the version/dependencies and publish as new npm so easy to add to my (and other) projects 
- Add the package to my Storybook project so I can use the plugin as expected
