## New Development Setup

Make sure to get .env file and save in ./app 

```
yarn install
cd app
yarn dev
yarn storybook 
```

We use prettier for code formatting, please configure your IDE 
to reformat on save

Prettier is installed as part of the project so can just use from node_module

and modified https://github.com/iway1/react-ts-form

More docs to come...
